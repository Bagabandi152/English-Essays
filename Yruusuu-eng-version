I’m not sad at all
It’s just some feelings
But I can’t leave it like that
I didn’t want to just sit and watch.
    I’m not sad at all
    It’s just some feelings
    But I can’t leave it like that
    I didn’t want just sit and watch.

Hoidaav:

We born then suffer, if lucky enough we will die
Everyone I loved, will they miss me?
I was just someone and will be
Even if I left, you have someone else
Waiting for death, smoking
At Bek’s we drink some beers
Even if my heart’s cold, my friend’s love is warm
Enjoying from suffer I will live till 30
Lady, I pushed you away already
So I say let’s get away from each other
That’s what I think everymorning
Became even worse than Rockitbay
But I still kept thinking about you
So didn’t want any other but  fell for only you baby
Every bitch I met, I could have made them mommy
if I have you by my side, it’s okay everyone to be our enemy
Your beauty was even more than Jennie’s
Used to say ‘I love you’ but shit, you were different back then.

I’m not sad at all
It’s just some feelings
But I can’t leave it like that
I didn’t want jut sit and watch
      It’s a suffering for me
      Even if I don’t tell to anyone
      Think inside, suffer inside…
      Life that everyone’s lost in  
      My music has no tone or vowels
      Think inside, suffer inside…    
      Breaks apart like a guitar string
      In fate of life you can’t tie it back
      On the taste of cheating my fate
      Breaks apart like a guitar string
      Breaks apart like a guitar string
      In fate of life you can’t tie it back
      On the taste of cheating my fate
      Breaks apart like a guitar string
      Breaks apart like a guitar string.
